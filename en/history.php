    		<p class="lead text-justify text-indent">For more than 26 centuries, Greeks used marble boxes to calculate commodity transactions. These cans were later published between the eastern and central regions of the Roman Empire.</p>
				<p class="lead text-justify text-indent">A box with sand or fine dust was then used to draw lines with sticks or fingers to perform calculations. It seems that the Chinese later succeeded in forming a different type of their abacus (SUAN PAN), a box with chopsticks bearing 5 lower and 2 upper beads.</p>

				<p class="lead text-justify text-indent">In the end, the Chinese abacus traveled to Japan in the 16th century through trade agreements between them. Japanese studied it for about 300 years and then removed a lower bead and later another superior to reach their own abacus in 1930, which develops intelligence more than others.</p>

				<ul class="h5 text-left">
					<li>Develop children's mental abilities.</li>
					<li>Balance between the right and left lobes of the brain.</li>
					<li>Improve the child's attention, speed in reading, writing and self-confidence.</li>
					<li>Acquire many mental talents that will help them forever.</li>
					<li>Develop mental capacity, increase responsiveness and improve memory.</li>
					<li>Increase the number of brain cells used during operations.</li>
					<li>Activates the right lobe of the brain (scientists have discovered in an experiment that the right lobe has recorded a strong electrical activity, when placed under the device of a brain electrical diagram while the mental calculation of the user by the perception of the abacus).</li>
					<li>Perform various calculations, regardless of size or complexity.</li>
					<li>The maturation of children's mathematics.</li>
					<li>The use of the sense of hearing and the sense of sight, attract the attention of the learner, which gives him a great ability to concentrate.</li>
					<li>Prevents aging of the brain and Alzheimer's disease. In fact, during the movement of the fingers on the beads of the abacus, the influx of blood into the brain has been observed. That's why we organize Soroban classes in Japan for the elderly.</li>
					<li>The SOROBAN program is a meaningful and educational ground for the child, and instead of leaving it to negative influences, such as TV and video games, the child plays the program and really takes a fun time learning.</li>
					<li>Causes the learner to spend more time solving mathematical problems. Einstein says:<span class="font-weight-bold">The idea is not that I'm super smart, but that I spend more time solving problems</span></li>

				<p class="lead text-justify text-indent">A recent American study shows that habituating the human brain to mathematical calculations and solving mathematical problems improves people's mental health and fights the symptoms of depression and anxiety. The study was conducted by researchers at Duke University of America, and published its findings in the scientific journal Clinical Psychological Science.</p>
				<p class="lead text-justify text-indent">Researchers analyzed the brain activity of 186 students by MRI, performing certain mathematical operations based on information in their memory. And have found that mathematical process resolution, as a function of memory, stimulates an area in the brain called <span class="font-italic font-weight-bold"> Dorsal Prefrontal Cortex </span>, which is associated with Feelings of depression and anxiety.</p>
				<p class="lead text-justify text-indent">These researchers also found that the intense activity of this area in the brain is associated with decreased symptoms of anxiety and depression in people.</p>
				<p class="lead text-justify text-indent">They said these results will inspire them to develop new strategies to help people regulate their emotions and prevent symptoms of anxiety and depression, particularly in developing countries with anxiety and depression levels. high.</p>
